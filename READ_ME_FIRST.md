# READ ME FIRST

For some reason, the **PA1_template.md** file in my GitHub repository is only showing the first histogram, but none of the other three graphs. I've saved the **PA1_template_files/figure-html** folder there as well, so you can see that the code did indeed generate the four graphs.

If in doubt, you can also check **http://rpubs.com/stevescicluna/475113**, where I have published the .html output file, showing the four graphs.
